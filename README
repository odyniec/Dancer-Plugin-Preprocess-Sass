NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Preprocess::Sass - Generate CSS files from Sass/SCSS
    files

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Dancer::Plugin::Preprocess::Sass adds support for Sass/SCSS files in a
    Dancer web application.

    Add the plugin to your application:

        use Dancer::Plugin::Preprocess::Sass;

    Configure its settings in the YAML configuration file:

        plugins:
          "Preprocess::Sass":
            save: 1
            paths:
              - css
              - subdir/css

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Plugin::Preprocess::Sass adds support for Sass/SCSS files in a
    Dancer web application.

    When a request is received for a CSS file, the plugin looks for a
    Sass/SCSS file with the same name, and transforms it into CSS. The
    generated CSS file may then be saved and served as a regular static
    file. Every time the source Sass/SCSS file gets modified, the
    corresponding CSS file is regenerated.

CONFIGURATION
    The available configuration settings are described below.

  save
    If set to 0, then the CSS files are generated on-the-fly with every
    request. If set to 1, the files are generated once and saved, then
    served as static files later on.

    The files are saved in the same directory as the Sass/SCSS files, so the
    system user that the web application is running as must be allowed to
    write to that directory.

    Default: 0

  paths
    A list of paths to serve CSS files from. Each path is relative to the
    "public" directory of the application.

        plugins:
          "Preprocess::Sass":
            paths:
              - css
              - subdir/css

    Default: 'css'
